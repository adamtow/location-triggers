# Location Triggers
Location Triggers is part of Autocuts Suite, a collection of shortcuts that greatly enhance automation on iOS 13.

## What is Autocuts?
Autocuts is a background shortcut manager that works on top of Open App personal automation feature of Shortcuts in iOS 13. Choosing your most commonly used applications to launch Autocuts in the background ensures that your shortcuts are constantly working behind the scenes to do things like:

- Set Do Not Disturb for specific calendar events.
- Turning on Low Power Mode when your battery falls below a certain percentage.
- Sending text messages, emails, or web requests at certain times of the day or when you arrive or leave locations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### The Shortcuts notification that it is running an automation is very distracting. Is there any way to get rid of it?
Yes, it is annoying. Unfortunately, there's no way to disable the notification, as it is controlled by iOS. File feedback with Apple using their [Feedback Assistant system](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com).

### What's the difference between Get Current Location and Get Current Weather?
Get Current Location is slower but more accurate. Get Current Weather is faster, but potentially less accurate. The former will also have an impact on battery life, as it will have to power up the GPS radios to pinpoint your location.

Consider setting your LimitKit settings so that Location Triggers is only checking your location every 15 minutes instead of 5 minutes.
